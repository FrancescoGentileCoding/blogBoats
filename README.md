This is the final project that I made entirely by myself.
It's a blog and I created these features:

- Site registration service
- LogIn service
- LogOUT service
- Post creation with custom dashboard
- Editing and/or deleting the post
- Encrypted passwords
- Authentication with personal token
- MongoDB database in which I find: the user's profile and his new or deleted posts
- Google Analytics to track visitor behavior .
